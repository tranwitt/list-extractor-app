# Json Extractor Application

This is an application on android that extracts data from a json file on the web and organizes the data into a readable list.


# How to build

Use the command in terminal while within the project directory: ./gradlew assembleRelease


# Running the application
Within the application there should be a list of ListId entries to choose from. If it is blank, there is something wrong with the internet connection or an error with the webpage the application is linked to.

Clicking on an entry will bring you to a list of names and Ids associated with the ListId.

Clicking the back button will bring you back to the original list of ListIds.
